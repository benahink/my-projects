/**
 *
 * @hack
 *
 * This is a dirty hack to fix URLs that have parenthesis and quotation marks in them
 * For example take this paragraph:
 *
 * """"
 * I visited this url: "http://www.wikipedia.com/some_article(with_paranthesis)"
 * and this URL: (http://www.wikipedia.com/some_article(with_paranthesis))
 * """"
 *
 * The quotation marks `'` `"` and parenthesis `(` `)` `[` `]`
 * can be considered to be part of the URL, and as a
 * punctuation marks surrounding the URL.
 * While this hack works for the most part, it's quite dirty and
 * I may replace it with something better in the future.
 *
 *
 * Another fix is removing punctuation marks that may appear at the end of URL
 * Example:
 *
 * """"
 * I've visited google.com, facebook.com, and yahoo.com.
 * """"
 *
 * @todo: replace the following function with something cleaner.
 *
